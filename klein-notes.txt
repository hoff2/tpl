possible design changes/refactorings:

have setup functions of parser and scanner return functions
semantic analyzer test cases
add parser test case for multiple occurrences of a symbol in rule
semantic stack: by reference?  dynamically (special) scoped?
scanner start-state parameter
error recovery (esp. parser) - "mention-error"
packaging
